    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>orange food coloring (Optional... but is a must!!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased mixing bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While dough is rising, combine powdered sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl for the topping. Mix with your hands or a spatula until a moldable dough forms. Mix in orange food coloring if you like.</li>
        <li>Divide topping dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls; set onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Cover each ball with a sheet of plastic and press down with something flat and heavy (like the bottom of a glass or measuring cup) into a flat circle. Take the tip of a knife and score a pumpkin design into the topping. Place in the refrigerator to allow butter to firm up.</li>
        <li>After the dough rises, transfer it onto a work surface and press down to remove the air. Cut into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball. Transfer balls onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet and press down to flatten lightly. Place the topping on top of the dough balls. Allow to proof until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of a preheated oven until puffed up and golden, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
